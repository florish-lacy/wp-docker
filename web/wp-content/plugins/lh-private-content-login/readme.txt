Redirects non-logged users to the login page when they follow a link to a post, page, or cpt which is protected by post status.

==Description== 

Do you post private content? Are you sending those links to your users with private content access? 

Wordpress natively send non-logged in users to a 404 (content not found) page when they try to access a post, page, or cpt without rights. This plugin redirects those users to the login page. After successful login the user is then redirected back to the post, page, or cpt they were trying to access.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Private Content Login, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-private-content-login/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-log-queries/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.


= What if I need an enhancement or feature that is not in the plugin?  =

Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: [https://shawfactor.com/contact/](https://shawfactor.com/contact/)

= How do I change the text explaing the need to login?  =

Currently if a visitor tries to access content that is private the visitor is redirected to the login page and the message: "This content is private you will need to login and have appropriate access." is displayed. This string itself is fully translatable but translations files are not icluded in the plugin itself. You can translate or modify the entire message (including the html) directly using the "lh_private_content_login_display_login_message" filter.

==Installation== 

1. Upload the entire `lh-private-content-login` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
