						<p>Florish maintains different delivery tiers, depending on geographical location and regional density. We measure between your location and the customer's delivery address which go into 3 tiers; tier 1 (0-4.99 miles), tier 2 (0-9.99 miles) and tier 3 (0-15). Upon onboarding, you can review the specific rates for your region, which are paid through to Nursery Partners.</p>

				<div id="collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
					<div class="accordion-body">
						<p> There are no fees to have an account, itâ€™s free. Florish has set pricing we pay through to you for each item/size you fulfill, which you will see and confirm during on-boarding. We do need your assistance during the onboarding process, which is usually a 30-minute process -- after that you only need to confirm and deliver orders in the Florish vendor portal. If you wish to discontinue an item or ran out of stock, you will be able to reflect that in your vendor portal (immediate action must be taken unless you will replenish inside your delivery window).</p>

					<div class="accordion-body">
						<p> A customer comes to the Florish Marketplace. They are located within your delivery radius. They are then paired to your nursery and can shop from all the plants you've elected to fulfill through Florish. They purchase a variety of plants and sizes. We notify you of the order (via email and through our vendor portal) - you claim the order (on same business day) by setting the delivery date (delivery within 5 days). You prepare and deliver the order, mark as "delivered", and the funds are deposited to your bank account on file.</p>

					<div class="accordion-body">
						<p> Yes, Florish can run sales or promotions. No, that will not impact what you receive. If you agree to fulfill a particular item for $90, you will receive $90 for every one you deliver, regardless of it's Florish Retail Price.</p>
